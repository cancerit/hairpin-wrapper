HAIRPIN DETECTION MODULE v1.0.6

Simple CLI for flagging of variants caused by hairpin/cruciform artifacts in LCM sequencing. 
Incorporates a streamlined subset of the process previously known as "Mathijs' Scripts".

USAGE:
hairpin 
-v input VCF path \
-b BAM path \
[-o] output path, defaults to current working directory \
[-g] specify genome build (hg37, hg38(default)) \
[-m] set java heap memory (default 10G) \
[-r] display available reference genomes \
[-h] display help \

NOTES:
Since the process requires the creation and accession of temp files,
best run from lustre for working dir (rather than home directory).

Reference genomes are specified by providing appropriate text strings to the -g flag.
E.g. "hg38", or "g37". The input text is (conservatively) matched against an index.
Check the index file with the -r flag to see list of available genomes.
If a reference genome is not shown when the -r flag it is used, it is not available.
This can be quickly resovled via a helpdesk ticket. 

BACKGROUND
Previously, scientists were performing this task with diffuse versions of a 
small pipeline built by Mathijs and added to by others over many years. 
This module brings together the components of that pipeline, 
strips out the extraneous functionality, 
and packages them into a single command, and single version, 
for ease of use and referencing. 

The various components that have been removed or pared down either unused stats, 
or were program functionality which would be better placed elsewhere.
such as prefiltering of input VCFs according to CLPM. 
Do one thing, and do it well.
